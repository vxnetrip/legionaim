# YOLO-TensorRT Aimbot (Patched) 🎯

> ⚠️ **Notice:** This project is for **educational and research purposes only**. It is no longer functional in live environments and is **fully patched**. Do not use this software for any unethical or unauthorized activity.

## 📌 About

This project showcases a proof-of-concept aimbot built using:

- 🧠 [YOLO](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) (You Only Look Once) for object detection  
- ⚡ [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) for real-time inference acceleration

The purpose is to demonstrate the integration of modern AI models with real-time computer vision tasks.

## 🚫 Status

> ❌ This aimbot has been **patched** and no longer works in any official or competitive environments.

The project is **non-functional in production**, and will not give users any in-game advantage. It is preserved here **purely for learning, experimentation, and academic review**.

## 💡 Educational Use

This repo is a great starting point to:

- Learn how YOLO-based models can be deployed in real-time
- Understand TensorRT optimization for fast inference
- Explore how AI can be misused — and how it can be mitigated

We do **not condone** the use of this software to violate the terms of service of any game or platform.
